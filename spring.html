    <h1>SPRING</h1>
    <img src="/Backend/375px-Spring_Framework_Logo_2018.svg.png" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p>The first version was written by Rod Johnson, who released the framework with the publication of his book Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development in October 2002. The framework was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003. The first production release, 1.0, was released in March 2004.[6] The Spring 1.2.6 framework won a Jolt productivity award and a JAX Innovation Award in 2006.[7][8] Spring 2.0 was released in October 2006, Spring 2.5 in November 2007, Spring 3.0 in December 2009, Spring 3.1 in December 2011, and Spring 3.2.5 in November 2013.[9] Spring Framework 4.0 was released in December 2013.[10] Notable improvements in Spring 4.0 included support for Java SE (Standard Edition) 8, Groovy 2,[11][12] some aspects of Java EE 7, and WebSocket.[13]

Spring Framework 4.2.0 was released on 31 July 2015 and was immediately upgraded to version 4.2.1, which was released on 01 Sept 2015.[14] It is "compatible with Java 6, 7 and 8, with a focus on core refinements and modern web capabilities".[15]

Spring Framework 4.3 has been released on 10 June 2016 and was supported until 2020.[16] It was announced to "be the final generation within the general Spring 4 system requirements (Java 6+, Servlet 2.5+), [...]".[15]

Spring 5 is announced to be built upon Reactive Streams compatible Reactor Core.[17][obsolete source]

Spring Framework 6.0 has been released on 16 November 2022 and came with a Java 17+ baseline and a move to Jakarta EE 9+ (in the jakarta namespace), with a focus on the recently released Jakarta EE 10 APIs such as Servlet 6.0 and JPA 3.1.[18]
Modules

The Spring Framework includes several modules that provide a range of services:

    Spring Core Container: this is the base module of Spring[19] and provides spring containers (BeanFactory and ApplicationContext).[20][21][22] In this context, spring-core is the artifact[23] found in the core module[24] belonging to the org.springframework group.[25] The spring-core artifact consists of the IoC container, as well as the utility classes[23] used throughout the application.[26]
    Aspect-oriented programming: enables implementing cross-cutting concerns.[27][28] The spring-aop is an artifact for the AOP framework.[24]
    Authentication and authorization: configurable security processes that support a range of standards, protocols, tools and practices via the Spring Security sub-project (formerly Acegi Security System for Spring).[29][30]
    Convention over configuration: a rapid application development solution for Spring-based enterprise applications is offered in the Spring Roo module.
    Data access: working with relational database management systems on the Java platform using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)[31] and object-relational mapping tools and with NoSQL[32] databases. The spring-jdbc is an artifact found in the JDBC module which supports JDBC access by including datasource setup classes.[24]
    Inversion of control container: configuration of application components and lifecycle management of Java objects, done mainly via dependency injection.[21]
    Messaging: declarative registration of message listener objects for transparent message-consumption from message queues via Java Message Service (JMS), improvement of message sending over standard JMS APIs.[33]
    Model–view–controller: an HTTP- and servlet-based framework providing hooks for extension and customization for web applications and RESTful (representational state transfer) Web services.[34][35]
    Remote access framework: declarative remote procedure call (RPC)-style[36] marshalling of Java objects over networks supporting Java remote method invocation (RMI),[37] CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and HTTP-based protocols including Web services such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).[38][39]
    Transaction management: unifies several transaction management APIs and coordinates transactions for Java objects.[40][41]
    Remote management: declarative exposure and management of Java objects for local or remote configuration via Java Management Extensions (JMX).[40][42]
    Testing: support classes for writing unit tests[43] and integration tests.[44]
    WebFlux support: support for using reactive runtimes or web servers such as UnderTow and Netty.[24][45]
    Web Socket support: Support for communicating using the WebSocket protocol. The artifact for this module is spring-websocket.
    XML support: support for object-toXML mapping.[24] Libraries such as Jakarta XML Binding(JAXB) and XStream are supported.[24] The artifact for this module is spring-oxm.</p>
